I arrived in San Salvador on Wednesday, May 18th! Travel went very smoothly, and I got through customs without any trouble. Shortly afterwards, I met up with Daniel and we got on our way!

Daniel’s aunt and uncle (Norma and Jesus) picked us up at the airport. Though it was already very dark, the heat and humidity were quite striking. I realized right away that the heat was going to be a big challenge for the pale Canadian kid that is me. On the way home we stopped for pupusas, which are tortillas stuffed with different combinations of cheese, vegetables and beans. Unbelievably delicious. We arrived at their house and quickly went to bed.

Today was my first chance to actually see San Salvador. Daniel’s cousin Julio drove Daniel and me around the city for most of the day, before having a great dinner at home and a relaxing evening.

San Salvador is really interesting. Before the trip, I had heard a lot about the unrest, poverty and violence affecting the city. While these issues are certainly present, they in no way define the city. My hosts have been truly welcoming, and others I met around the city were happy to hear me stumble along in Spanish. The accent is a little different than I am used to and my skills are about half what I thought they were, but hey, I have three months to improve!

I don’t have too much more to report, other than that I will be in San Salvador until Sunday when we head to the island. Today Daniel and I hashed out a good plan for our work, and things are looking really promising. Everything is coming together nicely! I will make another more comprehensive post when I get to the island, but I thought this was a good time to make a quick post. ¡Hasta la proxima!
