The past few days in San Salvador have been quite exciting. We’ve been doing errands around downtown and the western side of the city and spending time working in cafés. I’m starting to gain a feel and appreciation for the capital.

Last night, we went out for drinks with some of Daniel’s friends at a bar called “The Beer House”. Good beer and even better company! I must say, I think my Spanish improves greatly after a beer or two. I had a great time and almost felt like I was on a patio back home in the summertime. Definitely a highlight of the trip so far.

In terms of work, things are going very well. We have been taking advantage of our access to wifi in the city to put time into building the website. After a good number of hours in a café-bakery called San Martin, it is looking really nice. You can check it out at www.mareasdetasajera.com or through this site at Menu>Projects>Mareas de Tasajera. No data up yet and very much a work in progress, but the idea of the project is there. It’s also all in Spanish, but an English version of the site will be developed soon.

Tomorrow morning, we will be heading to Tasajera. We’ll likely have to come back to San Salvador in a few weeks to get some supplies and take a little break, but I am very excited to get to the island and develop a routine. If all goes according to plan, my next post will be from San Rafael la Tasajera!

I also have free unlimited access to Whatsapp! I’d love nothing more than messages from friends at home or elsewhere. My number is 503-7191-7056, shoot me a message anytime!

Hasta la proxima,

Kirk
